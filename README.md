# MOD_Project
This is my MOD I project. It's a task/to-do web application where you fill out the task name, select priority, pick a due date, and task description. The input value (task) will then be displayed onto different tasklist columns based on priority and due date. Each task has a delete button. When the task is complete you just delete it from the task list.

It took awhile to get the different elements laid out the way I wanted. I re-started this project three times. My initial struggle was getting the columns and rows to display correctly using Grid. I re-started the project on the second day using Flexbox but then got stuck on the layout. I wanted to create something visually appealing but wasn't sure how to go about accomplishing that. On the third day, I re-started the project with a much clearer idea of how I wanted the application to look. I struggled with the layout using CSS and implementing five event listeners. Overall, the finished project is better than what I expected.
